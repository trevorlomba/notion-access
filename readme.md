# Custom Notion Files for Musicians with Accessibility Needs 

This Git repository contains a set of custom files designed specifically for musicians who have lost their ability to use traditional input methods but still want to create, access, and edit their musical compositions in the Notion program. The suite of programs is built to be used in a macOS environment and requires the use of the Accessibility Keyboard Panel Editor and third-party software called Keyboard Maestro.
Features

## The suite of programs in this repository offers the following features:

    Custom calibration tools
    Smart chord composition and input methods
    Multiple means to navigate the Notion score
    Access to file menus through the accessibility keyboard
    Integration with Keyboard Maestro to execute scripts that aid in user input and window manipulations within the Notion program.

## System Requirements

To use the custom files in this repository, you will need the following:

    A macOS environment
    The Accessibility Keyboard Panel Editor
    Keyboard Maestro.

## Installation

To install the custom files, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine using the command git clone <repository-url>.
    Open the Accessibility Keyboard Panel Editor.
    Import the included .keylayout files into the editor.
    Set up Keyboard Maestro and import the included scripts.

## Usage

Once you have installed the custom files, you can use the accessibility keyboard to open/close keyboard toolbars, navigate to new keyboard panels, or trigger keyboard events that will in turn trigger Keyboard Maestro to execute scripts that aid in user input and window manipulations within the Notion program. The custom calibration tools, smart chord composition and input methods, and multiple means to navigate the Notion score are all designed to make it easier for musicians with accessibility needs to use the program.
